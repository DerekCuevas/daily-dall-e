> Using the poetic and colorful language of Salvador Dali's surrealist style, I describe the artwork: 

"Behold a masterful cosmic tapestry infused with the ferocious spirit of the roaring Steelers, the timeless melodies of the Now and Then Beatles, and the unconquerable fortitude of the Warriors - a triumphant and mind-bending masterpiece that defies all logic and expectation."

1. Steelers
1. Now and Then Beatles
1. Warriors
